#Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning 🧠

A complete machine learning pipeline to classify text sentiment using traditional ML algorithms and TF-IDF vectorization.

#Dataset 📁

Used a labeled dataset with text samples and sentiment categories (e.g., Positive, Negative, Neutral).
Supports two datasets for training and testing.

#Features⚙️

Data Cleaning (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopwords, etc.)

TF-IDF vectorization

Training models like:

Logistic Regression

Linear SVM

Decision Tree

Model evaluation using cross-validation

Sentiment prediction on custom user input

📊 Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated using:

Accuracy score

Cross-validation (5-fold)

Comparison between multiple classifiers
